# Setup Guide 
Please follow the steps below to set up the Azure environment

# Step 1: Download Files
Clone or download this repository and navigate to the project's root directory.

# Step 2: Synapse Security Access

### Step 2.1: Add your IP address to Azure Synapse Analytics firewall
Before you can upload assests to the Synapse Workspace you will need to add your IP address:
1. Go to the Synapse resource you created in the previous step. 
2. Navigate to `Networking` under `Security` on the left hand side of the page.
3. At the top of the screen click `+ Add client IP`
    ![Update Firewalls](./img/deploy-firewall.png)  
4. Your IP address should now be visible in the IP list and click `Save` at the top

### Step 2.2: Update storage account permissions
In order to perform the necessary actions in Synapse workspace, you will need to grant more access.
1. Go to the Azure Data Lake Storage Account for your Synapse Workspace
> * **Note**: you will see two storage accounts created in the resource group, be sure to select the Synapse Workspace Storage account and **not** the machine learning storage account
2. Go to the `Access Control (IAM) > + Add > Add role assignment` 
3. Now search and select the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role and click "Next" 
4. Click "+ Select members", search and select your username and click "Select" 
5. Click `Review and assign` at the bottom
